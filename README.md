What did you like about this project?
- This project allow me to understand what it is like to be a developer. The time restriction and the pressure to complete allow you to have a better understanding of the real world.

What did you struggle with this project?
    There are 2 struggles. 
    1. Margin & Padding
    2. Flex-box positioning

However, the major struggle is with the maniplation of the flex-box. Mainly the placement is the biggest struggle for me. 
The need to pre-plan the amount of division and decipher what went wrong during styling is the biggest struggle.
I have trouble understanding how to use the various command at different axises. (justify-content/items, align-content/items)

What would make your experience with this assessment better?
- Personally i would need more different scenario to practice with the flexbox placement. In theory I seem to be able to comprehend but unfortunately it is not the case when it comes to practical.
